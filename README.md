## Installation

### Community plugins (currently unavailable)

1. In settings, in the **Community plugins** tab, click **Browse**
2. Search for **obsidian.fm**, then click **Install**
3. Ensure **obsidian.fm** is enabled under **Installed plugins**

### BRAT

1. Install BRAT from the community plugins in Obsidian
2. Copy the GitHub repository link: https://github.com/yipqp/obsidian.fm
3. Open the command palette and run **BRAT: Plugins: Add a beta plugin for testing**
4. Paste in the GitHub link and click **Add plugin**
5. In settings, ensure **obsidian.fm** is enabled under the **Community plugins** tab

### Manual

1. On the GitHub repository, under **Releases**, download the three files under the latest release: **main.js**, **manifest.json**, and **styles.css**
2. Locate the directory of your Obsidian vault, then make a new directory under **.obsidian/plugins** and name it **obsidian-fm**
3. Move the three files you just downloaded into **obsidian-fm**

## Note

This plugin does not require, but highly encourages, the use of the [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) plugin. New song notes are named with a unique ID generated by Spotify to avoid file conflicts from songs with the same name, songs containing special characters, etc. Without Front Matter Title, filenames will appear as raw IDs. In the Front Matter Title settings, an example **Common main template** entry is `{{artists}} - {{name}}`.

## Usage

- Open the command palette and search for **obsidian.fm: Connect Spotify**
- Log into Spotify and authorize access
- Start using any commands in the command palette

## Settings

- **Connect Spotify**: connect your Spotify account
- **Folder path**: path of folder to store newly created notes
- **Create new file for each track when logging albums**: when logging albums, create a new note for each track in that album's tracklist if it hasn't been logged yet, then include wikilinks for these song notes in the album note's `tracks` frontmatter. When disabled (default behavior), only include wikilinks for song notes that already exist in the vault, and use plain text for the unlogged song notes.
- **New file frontmatter preferences**
	- **Type**: type of media, either "Track" or "Album"
	- **Duration**: length of the track or album
	- **Album release date**: release date of album (only relevant in album notes)
	- **Tags**: optional tags to add to new notes, e.g. "add-to-playlist"

## Limitations
- No support for podcasts, audiobooks, or local files (albums)
